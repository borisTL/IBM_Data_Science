    "# Overview of Libraries, Data, and Machine Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "## Libraries & Modules\n",
    "- Libraries often have **built-in modules** that offer diverse functionalities.\n",
    "- An **API** (Application Programming Interface) facilitates communication between software pieces.\n",
    "  - It's the visible part of a library, while the library houses all program components.\n",
    "- **REST APIs** enable online communication and tap into resources like storage, AI algorithms, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Visualization & Open Data\n",
    "- **Data visualization** aids in conveying results meaningfully.\n",
    "- **Open data** plays a pivotal role in Data Science.\n",
    "  - The **Community Data License Agreement** simplifies open data sharing.\n",
    "  - **IBM Data Asset eXchange (DAX)** offers quality open data sets.\n",
    "    - DAX data sets come with tutorial notebooks for developers.\n",
    "    - DAX notebooks are compatible with Watson Studio.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Machine Learning & Deep Learning\n",
    "- **Machine Learning (ML)** employs algorithms to discern data patterns.\n",
    "  - ML Types: Supervised, Unsupervised, and Reinforcement.\n",
    "    - **Supervised Learning** models: Regression and Classification.\n",
    "  - **Deep Learning**: Techniques mirroring human brain functions to solve diverse problems.\n",
    "    - **Model Asset eXchange**: A repository for deep-learning microservices.\n",
    "      - MAX model-serving microservices are available as open-source Docker images on GitHub.\n",
    "      - Utilize **Red Hat OpenShift** for automating microservice deployment and management.\n",
    "      - [Ml-exchange.org](http://ml-exchange.org) offers numerous predefined models.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tools & Frameworks\n",
    "- For ML: **Scikit-learn** for statistical modeling, including regression, classification, etc.\n",
    "- For Deep Learning production: **TensorFlow** as a foundational framework.\n",
    "- **Apache Spark**: A cluster-computing framework for data processing on computing clusters.\n"
